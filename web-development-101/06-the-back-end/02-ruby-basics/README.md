#### 02. Variables

- Ruby doesn't need to declare variables. They're created when you assign a value to them
- Ruby evaluates right to left
- Ruby's variables are flexible -- They can be assigned any type

##### 02.1 Naming Variables

- local variables always start with a lowercase letter
- They have no spaces
- do not contain special characters
- They are typically in snake case
- Named after the meaning of their contents, not the type of their contents
- not abbreviated

#### 03. Strings

- Negative positions in a string start at the end and count backwards
